# Deployment Guide for DHF Rake Detection

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Node.js Compatibility Issue
- **Problem**: Vite 6.0.1 was causing `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` errors on Vercel due to Node.js compatibility issues
- **Solution**: Downgraded to Vite 5.4.10 which is more stable and compatible with Vercel's Node.js environment

### 2. Dependency Conflicts
- **Problem**: Multiple Excel libraries (`exceljs`, `xlsx-style`, `react-data-export`) were causing build conflicts
- **Solution**: Removed problematic packages and standardized on `xlsx` library for all Excel exports

### 3. Build Configuration
- **Problem**: External dependencies were not being bundled properly
- **Solution**: Updated Vite config to properly chunk dependencies and removed external configurations

## Files Modified

1. **package.json**
   - Downgraded Vite from 6.0.1 to 5.4.10
   - Removed `exceljs`, `xlsx-style`, and `react-data-export`
   - Added Node.js engine requirements

2. **vite.config.js**
   - Removed external dependency configurations
   - Added proper chunking for large libraries
   - Set target to es2020 for better compatibility

3. **vercel.json**
   - Added explicit build configuration
   - Specified output directory and framework

4. **.nvmrc**
   - Created file to specify Node.js version 20

5. **Component Files**
   - Updated Dashboard.jsx to use only `xlsx` library
   - Updated AssignedWagon.jsx to remove `exceljs` usage

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push to Repository**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix build issues for Vercel deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Vercel Deployment**
   - Vercel will automatically detect the changes
   - Build should now complete successfully
   - The app will be deployed with proper chunking for better performance

## Build Performance

The build now generates optimized chunks:
- `xlsx-chunk`: 284.03 kB (Excel functionality)
- `lucide-chunk`: 12.41 kB (Icons)
- `date-fns-chunk`: 1.45 kB (Date utilities)
- Main bundle: 314.01 kB

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Clear Vercel Build Cache**
   - Go to Vercel dashboard
   - Redeploy with "Clear Build Cache" option

2. **Check Node.js Version**
   - Ensure Vercel is using Node.js 18+ (specified in .nvmrc)

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Make sure all required environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard

## Success Indicators

✅ Local build completes without errors
✅ All dependencies properly chunked
✅ Excel export functionality working with xlsx library
✅ No external dependency conflicts
✅ Compatible with Vercel's Node.js environment
